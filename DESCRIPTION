Description: To test the absence of an effect, one can use equivalence testing. There are a multitude of approaches. See [Lakens (2022, Ch. 9)](https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/09-equivalencetest.html) for details. `mixequiv` capitalizes on two approaches to deteremine equivalence: the confidence interval method and the two one-sided t-test.
